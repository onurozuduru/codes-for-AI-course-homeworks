* Uniform-cost search
* Depth-first search
* Iterative deepening search
* Greedy Best Search
* A* Search

Test all the algorithms with at least 10 random inputs and calculate both the number of nodes expanded and the maximum number of nodes saved in the memory. Write one page report giving the results of your experiments and make comments on the results.
